Testing S4 inheritance
======================

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zkamvar/inheritest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zkamvar/inheritest)

I have a problem with basic inheritance of the `[` operator for S4 objects that
implement custom arguments. This is a working example from [a stackoverflow post
I created](http://stackoverflow.com/q/42894213/2752888).

Installation
------------

You can install it via github, and it should work:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("zkamvar/inheritest")
```

When it works
-------------

It works if the package is built to your system

```{r}
library("inheritest")
foo <- new("foo", x = pi, y = 2)
foo["x"]
foo["y", foo = FALSE]
bar <- new("bar", x = pi, y = 2, distance = 0)
bar["x"]
bar["distance", bar = FALSE]
```

When it doesn't work
--------------------

It doesn't work if the package is simply loaded:


In the shell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zkamvar/inheritest.git
cd inheritest
```

In R:

```{r, error=TRUE}
devtools::load_all(".")
foo <- new("foo", x = pi, y = 2)
foo["x"]
foo["y", foo = FALSE]
bar <- new("bar", x = pi, y = 2, distance = 0)
bar["x"]
bar["distance", bar = FALSE]
```
